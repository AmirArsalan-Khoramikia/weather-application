# Weather Application

This is a weather application built using **Vite.js**, **React**, and **Material UI**, which allows users to check the weather in different cities by fetching real-time data from a public weather API. The application is designed to be lightweight, fast, and responsive, offering a seamless experience across all devices.

## 🌟 Features

- **🔍 Search by City**: Users can enter the name of a city to retrieve the current weather conditions.
- **🌤 Real-time Weather Data**: The app provides up-to-date weather information, including:
  - Temperature
  - Humidity
  - Wind speed
  - Weather description (e.g., clear, cloudy, etc.)
- **📱 Responsive Design**: Designed with **Material UI**, ensuring the app looks great and functions well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **⚡ Fast Development Experience**: Built with **Vite.js**, the app offers fast build times and efficient hot-reload during development.
- **🌍 Multiple Cities**: The app supports weather data fetching for any city worldwide.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **[Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/)**: A next-generation front-end build tool that significantly improves the speed of development with fast builds and optimized HMR (Hot Module Replacement).
- **[React](https://reactjs.org/)**: A JavaScript library for building component-based user interfaces, making the UI highly modular and reusable.
- **[Material UI](https://mui.com/)**: A popular React component library that adheres to Google's Material Design principles, ensuring a modern, accessible, and responsive design.
- **Weather API**: The app fetches real-time weather data from a public API such as **OpenWeatherMap**, allowing users to see current weather conditions for any city.

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have **Node.js** (>= 12.x) and **npm** or **yarn** installed on your machine.

### Step 1: Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-app.git
cd weather-app
```

### Step 2: Install dependencies

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
npm install
# OR
yarn install
```

### Step 3: Create `.env` File

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your API key for the weather service (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).

```bash
REACT_APP_WEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

> You can get a free API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/appid).

### Step 4: Start the development server

To start the development server and begin working on the application, use:

```bash
npm run dev
# OR
yarn dev
```

The app will be running locally at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Step 5: Build for production

When you're ready to deploy, you can build the app for production:

```bash
npm run build
# OR
yarn build
```

This will create an optimized production build in the `dist` folder.

## 🧪 Testing

While basic functionality is tested during development, setting up automated tests with a tool like **Jest** or **React Testing Library** is recommended for production-level projects.

### Running Tests

```bash
npm run test
# OR
yarn test
```

## 🌍 Deployment

Once you've built the app for production, you can deploy the `dist` folder to any static site hosting service, such as **Netlify**, **Vercel**, or **GitHub Pages**.

For Vercel deployment, simply connect the repository to your Vercel account, and it will automatically deploy your app every time you push a change to the main branch.
