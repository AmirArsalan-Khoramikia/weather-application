  - Humidity
  - Wind speed
  - Weather description (e.g., clear, cloudy, etc.)
- **📱 Responsive Design**: Designed with **Material UI**, ensuring the app looks great and functions well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **⚡ Fast Development Experience**: Built with **Vite.js**, the app offers fast build times and efficient hot-reload during development.
- **🌍 Multiple Cities**: The app supports weather data fetching for any city worldwide.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **[Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/)**: A next-generation front-end build tool that significantly improves the speed of development with fast builds and optimized HMR (Hot Module Replacement).
- **[React](https://reactjs.org/)**: A JavaScript library for building component-based user interfaces, making the UI highly modular and reusable.
- **[Material UI](https://mui.com/)**: A popular React component library that adheres to Google's Material Design principles, ensuring a modern, accessible, and responsive design.
